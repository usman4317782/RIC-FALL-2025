## Question 1
Write short answers to the following:
1. What is the difference between an integer variable and a floating-point variable in C++?  
2. How does operator precedence affect the result of an arithmetic expression?

Then write a C++ program that:
- Declares two integer variables and one floating-point variable.  
- Takes input from the user for all variables.  
- Performs and displays results of addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus operations.  
- Evaluates one arithmetic expression using parentheses to show precedence.

## Question 2
Answer briefly:
1. What is the difference between prefix and postfix increment/decrement operators?

Then write a C++ program that:
- Declares an integer variable `x` and takes its value from the user.  
- Demonstrates prefix and postfix increment and decrement operators.  
- Uses relational operators to check and display whether `x` is greater than, equal to, or less than 10.
