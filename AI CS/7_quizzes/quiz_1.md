## ✏️ Quiz Questions

### Q1.  
Differentiate between **supervised**, **unsupervised**, and **semi-supervised** learning in terms of data labeling, algorithmic approach, and practical application.  
Provide **one challenging real-world example** where semi-supervised learning would outperform purely supervised or unsupervised methods, and justify why.

---

### Q2.  
A research team is developing a system that automatically classifies X-ray images as “Normal,” “Pneumonia,” or “Tuberculosis.”  
- Identify the **type of learning** and **specific ML task** involved.  
- Discuss how **imbalanced data** and **feature selection** could affect the model’s performance, and suggest one mitigation strategy for each issue.

---

### Q3.  
Compare the **role of features** and **target variables** in both regression and classification problems.  
Using an example, explain how an **improper feature selection process** could lead to **overfitting or underfitting** in a predictive model.

---

### Q4.  
Consider a scenario where an ML algorithm continuously improves its strategy for controlling a self-driving car through trial and error.  
- Identify the **learning paradigm** involved.  
- Explain how **reward functions** influence learning outcomes and discuss one **ethical or safety challenge** associated with this approach.

## 💡 Tips for Solving:
- Think beyond basic definitions — link **concepts to real-world data challenges**.  
- Mention **problems like overfitting, data imbalance, noise, and bias** where relevant.  
- Use **precise ML terminology**: features, target, reward function, generalization, etc.  
- Be concise but **analytically rich** — focus on *why* a concept matters, not just *what* it is.
