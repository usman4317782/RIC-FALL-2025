## Part C – If Statements & Decisions

13. Ask the user to enter their age. Print whether they are a:

- **child** (<13)
- **teenager** (13–19)
- **adult** (20–64)
- **senior** (65+)

14. Create a list of usernames. Print a special greeting if the username is `admin`, otherwise greet normally.

15. Ask the user for a number. Print whether it is **even or odd** using the modulo operator.

16. Write a grading program:

    - Score ≥ 90 → A
    - 80–89 → B
    - 70–79 → C
    - 60–69 → D
    - Below 60 → F

17. Ask the user for a password. Check:

    - Is it at least 8 characters long?
    - Does it contain `@` or `#`?
    - Print if it's valid or not.

18. Create a program that checks if a number is positive, negative, or zero.

19. Write a program that determines if a year is a leap year:
    - Divisible by 4 and not divisible by 100, OR
    - Divisible by 400

## Part D – User Input & While Loops

20. Ask the user to enter pizza toppings until they type `quit`. Print a message for each topping added.

21. Write a program that asks the user for numbers until they type `stop`. At the end, print the **average** of all numbers entered.

22. Create a program that simulates restaurant seating:

    - Ask how many people are in the group
    - If more than 8 → print "You'll have to wait for a table."
    - Else → "Your table is ready."

23. Build a simple calculator:

    - Ask for two numbers and an operator (`+ - * /`)
    - Perform the calculation
    - Keep running until the user types `exit`

24. Make a "Guess the Number" game:

    - Pick a random number between 1 and 20
    - Ask the user to guess until correct
    - Give hints: "Too high" or "Too low"
    - Count the number of attempts

25. Create a program that asks for user input until they enter a valid email address (contains `@` and `.`).
