## 📝 Comprehensive Written Quiz Question: HTML Application and Structure

---

### Scenario:

You are tasked with creating the main registration page for a new online learning platform called **"CodeAcademy Pro."** This page must be a single, well-structured HTML document that demonstrates your mastery of core HTML elements, including **semantic tags, links, images, forms, and tables.**

---

### Task:

Write the complete, well-indented HTML code for this page and provide a brief technical analysis as requested below.

#### I. HTML Code Requirements:

1.  **HTML Structure:** The page must use the `<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags correctly and include a descriptive `<title>`.
2.  **Semantic Layout:** The page body must be logically divided using appropriate **semantic tags** for a `<header>`, a `<main>` content area, and a `<footer>`.
3.  **Header Content:** The `<header>` must include:
    * An **image** acting as the company logo (use a placeholder `src` of `"logo.png"`).
    * A navigation section containing three functional **hyperlinks** to other pages (Home, Courses, About). Two links must use a **relative path**, and one must use an an **absolute path** to an external site (e.g., Google).
4.  **Main Content (Form):** The `<main>` area must contain a **course registration form** that includes:
    * A proper `<form>` tag with placeholder values for the `action` and `method` attributes.
    * Input fields for **Full Name** (text) and **Email** (email type).
    * A dropdown selection menu (using a `<select>` tag) for three different course options.
    * A dedicated **Submit** button.
5.  **Footer Content (Table):** The `<footer>` must contain a simple **table** that displays the platform's current system status, including:
    * A table header row (`<th>`) with the columns **"Service"** and **"Status"**.
    * At least three data rows (`<tr>`, `<td>`) providing sample status information (e.g., "Database: Operational," "API Server: Operational," "Live Chat: Maintenance").

#### II. Technical Analysis Requirements:

Below your HTML code, provide a brief (1-2 sentence) explanation of the technical purpose of the following five attributes/tags, citing them from your code:

1.  The `alt` attribute on your **image** tag.
2.  The `target` attribute on one of your **link** tags.
3.  The `method` attribute on your **form** tag.
4.  The `<th>` tag within your **table** structure.
5.  A chosen **semantic tag** (e.g., `<main>`, `<header>`, or `<footer>`).
