# 🤖 AI Hackathon 2025 — Python + Django Innovation Sprint

**Organized by:** Riphah School of Computing & Innovation  
**Event Date:** 12 November 2025  
**Duration:** 1–2 Hours  
**Team Size:** Up to 2 Members  
**Submission:** GitHub Repository + Live Demo Presentation  
**Allowed Resources:** Python libraries, Django framework, pre-trained AI models, and open APIs  

---

## 🧭 Event Overview
Welcome to the **AI Hackathon 2025 — Python + Django Edition!**  
This challenge blends **AI problem-solving** with **real-world web application development**.  
Your task: design and implement a small-scale **AI-powered Django web app** that demonstrates intelligent features such as prediction, recommendation, or content analysis — all within a 1–2 hour sprint.

---

## 🎨 Theme
**AI for Smarter Web Solutions**

Create a Django-based web app that integrates **Artificial Intelligence** to improve user interaction, automate tasks, or provide intelligent insights.  
Focus on **simplicity**, **functionality**, and **real-world relevance**.

---

## ⚙️ Project Details

### 🎯 Objective
Build a Django web app that:
- Uses Python-based AI logic or a pre-trained model for prediction, classification, or generation.  
- Includes at least **one functional AI feature** (e.g., text analysis, image recognition, chatbot, etc.).  
- Has a **simple and functional frontend** built with Django templates.  
- Is fully runnable and demo-ready by the end of the event.

|--------|----------------|--------------|
| 1 | **SmartReview** | A Django web app that uses NLP to analyze customer feedback and display sentiment results. |
| 2 | **AIResumeRanker** | A recruiter tool that ranks uploaded resumes based on job keywords using text similarity. |
| 3 | **QuickPredict** | A numeric prediction web app (e.g., house price, GPA, or sales) using a regression model. |
| 4 | **VisionScan** | An image classifier (e.g., detecting fruits, vehicles, or handwritten digits) integrated into a Django interface. |
| 5 | **ChatMentor** | A mini chatbot built using OpenAI or Hugging Face API, served through a Django web form. |

## 📦 Deliverables
Each team must submit:
1. A **GitHub repository** containing:
   - Django project folder (`manage.py`, app folders, templates, etc.)  
   - AI-related Python scripts or Jupyter notebooks  
   - `README.md` explaining setup steps, features, and tech stack  
   - Screenshots or short demo video  
2. A **live 2–3 minute demo**, including:
   - Problem and solution overview  
   - How AI is implemented  
   - Core features demonstration  

---

## 🧠 Judges Will Observe
- How well AI is integrated into Django (not separate scripts).  
- Simplicity and clarity of code structure.  
- Relevance and originality of AI use case.  
- UI clarity and data flow between AI and web interface.  
- Confidence and communication during demo.  

---

## 🧰 Rules
- Internet usage is **allowed** for documentation and libraries.  
- Pre-trained models and open-source datasets are permitted.  
- Only **Python + Django** frameworks allowed (no Flask, FastAPI, etc.).  
- No prior templates — you must build from scratch or minimal boilerplate.  
- Code must be **pushed to GitHub** before the demo deadline.  

---

## 🏅 Rewards & Recognition
- 🥇 **Top 3 Teams:** Certificates + Internship Shortlisting  
- 🧠 **Best AI Integration Award**  
- 💡 **Best Technical Implementation Award**  
- 🌟 **Post-event Mentorship:** Top teams may receive project mentorship or research collaboration offers.  

---

## 🚀 Pro Tips
- Use a small, lightweight model — large models will slow you down.  
- Focus on one working AI feature — quality > quantity.  
- Use Django’s built-in form and template system for simplicity.  
- Keep your README and GitHub repo clean and well-documented.  
- During your demo, **explain how the AI connects to Django** — that’s what impresses judges most.
