### ✏️ Quiz Questions:

**Q1.** The environment is crucial for an agent's design. Differentiate between the following environment properties with one short, illustrative example for each pair:  
a) Stochastic vs. Deterministic  
b) Episodic vs. Sequential  

---

**Q2.** An agent's action is determined by a mapping. Distinguish clearly between the **Agent Function** and the **Agent Program** in the context of an Artificial Agent. Why is the Agent Program considered the *physical realization* of the Agent Function?

---

**Q3.** The **Turing Test** is a foundational concept in AI. Explain the core objective of the Turing Test and state one major philosophical or practical argument against relying solely on it to define true Artificial Intelligence.

---

**Q4.** Compare and contrast the operational difference between a **Simple Reflex Agent** and a **Model-Based Reflex Agent**. Provide a real-world scenario where the "model" (internal state) is absolutely essential for the agent's success.

---

**Q5.** Define a **Performance Measure** and a **Utility Function** in the context of agent design. Explain how a fully rational agent, operating in a complex environment, uses the Utility Function to select the optimal sequence of actions.

### 💡 Tips for Solving:
- Review the **properties of environments** and how they constrain the agent design.  
- Understand the distinction between the *theoretical* function and the *practical* program.  
- Recall the **Turing Test's goal** and its main critiques.  
- Focus on the internal structure (i.e., the *model*) that separates simple and model-based agents.  
- Define performance and utility, and how utility guides **decision-making**.
